<h1>About Me</h1><hr>
Greetings!<br> <p></p>
Thank you for checking out my projects. Granted they might not be my best, but I assure you my future projects will be much better. I'm still in very early stages of learning web development at this moment.<br><p></p>
I'm keen on learning more and getting better at this. After all, having useful skills nowadays are much more in demand than a college degree, am I right?

Anyways, I've wasted enough of your time. I'll let you get back to browsing my other and hopefully much improved projects.
