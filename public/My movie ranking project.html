<h1>Some of the best movies I've watched</h1>
<h2>List of movies off the top of my head</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Inception</h3>
One of the best Nolan movie in my opinion.
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
Use of real world physics makes this one of the best science fiction movie for me.
<h3>Casino</h3>
Martin Scorsese and Robert de Niro is a cocktail never to be missed out on. Easily the best crime/mafia movie in my opinion.
<h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
Wes Anderson at his best. If you aren't familiar with his movies, then you are in for a treat with this one.
<h3>Oldboy</h3>
Park Chan-wook and his dark humor will definitely take you through an emotional rollercoaster.
<h3>The Revenant</h3>
The best drama movie ever hand's down. Alejandro Gonzalez Innaritu's masterpiece for sure.
<h3>Prisoners</h3>
David Villenueve never disappoints. Neither does Hugh Jackman and Paul Dano in this one. 
<h3>Seven</h3>
How can any list be complete without including atleast one of David Fincher's movie? If you've already watched it, check out his other movies.
